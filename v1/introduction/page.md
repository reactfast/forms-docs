## Quick start

Get ReactFast Forms running in your project in under 5 minutes.

### Installing dependencies

Install ReactFast Forms and its peer dependencies:

```shell
npm install @reactfast/forms react react-dom
```

ReactFast Forms requires **React 18+** and **React DOM 18+** as peer dependencies.

{% callout type="warning" title="React Version Requirement" %}
Make sure you're using React 18 or higher. ReactFast Forms uses modern React features that aren't available in older versions.
{% /callout %}

### Your first form

Create a simple form with just a few lines of code:

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";
import { Form, createFormHandler, initForm } from "@reactfast/forms";

const fields = [
  { name: "firstName", title: "First Name", type: "string", width: 50 },
  { name: "lastName", title: "Last Name", type: "string", width: 50 },
  { name: "email", title: "Email", type: "email", width: 100 },
  { name: "subscribe", title: "Subscribe?", type: "boolean", width: 100 },
];

export default function App() {
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState({});

  const handleChange = createFormHandler({
    fields,
    setState: setFormData,
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    initForms();
    setReady(true);
  }, []);

  return <Form fields={fields} onChange={handleChange} formData={formData} />;
}
```

That's it! You now have a fully functional form with validation, responsive layout, and state management.

{% callout title="Pro Tip" %}
The `createFormHandler` function automatically handles form state updates and applies any rules or modifiers you define. It's the heart of ReactFast Forms' power.
